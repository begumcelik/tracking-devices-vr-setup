# Tracking Devices in the VR Setup

The project is developed to track connected devices in the VR setup. In general, connections in the VR setup are not stable enough and necessitate human interference to restart the system. To solve this problem, tracked device information was gathered to automate the system using smart plugs. The [OpenVR API](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/openvr/wiki/API-Documentation) is implemented to check connected devices (HMD, Base Stations, Controllers). Since the OpenVR API allows you to interact with any Virtual Reality displays, this project is compatible with all headset brands (Oculus, Mixed Reality, Vive, etc).
